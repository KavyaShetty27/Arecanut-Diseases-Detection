## Abstract

Arecanut, also known as betel nut, is a vital tropical crop, with India being the second-largest producer and consumer globally. Despite its economic importance, arecanut plants are vulnerable to various diseases affecting their roots, trunk, and foliage throughout their growth cycle. Traditional disease detection relies on manual observation, which is labor-intensive and prone to inaccuracies.

This study presents a novel system utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automate the identification of arecanut diseases and provide actionable remedies. A custom dataset of 620 images, capturing both healthy and diseased samples, was developed and divided into training and testing sets in an 80:20 ratio. The CNN model was trained using:

- **Loss Function:** Categorical Cross-Entropy
- **Optimizer:** Adam Optimizer
- **Performance Metric:** Accuracy over 50 epochs

### Key Results:
- Disease detection accuracy: **88.46%**

This system offers farmers a reliable tool to manage and maintain crop health efficiently.

## Introduction

### General Overview
Agriculture serves as the backbone of many economies, particularly in tropical regions where a variety of crops hold cultural and economic significance. One such crop is arecanut, commonly known as betel nut, which plays a crucial role in the livelihoods of millions of farmers. India, being the second-largest producer of arecanut, relies heavily on its cultivation for socio-economic sustainability.

However, arecanut crops are vulnerable to numerous diseases affecting their roots, trunks, leaves, and fruits. These diseases, if left undetected and untreated, can lead to substantial crop losses, jeopardizing farmers' income and impacting the agricultural sector. Traditional methods of diagnosing plant diseases typically involve manual inspection, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human error. Advanced technologies like machine learning and image processing offer efficient and scalable alternatives.

### Relevance and Problem Statement
Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have transformed numerous industries, including agriculture. Leveraging deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), enables the analysis of crop images to detect diseases with remarkable accuracy. The primary issue faced by arecanut farmers is the lack of early disease identification tools, leading to delayed intervention and significant economic losses. This project aims to address these challenges by providing an automated, accurate, and cost-effective solution.

### Scope of the Project
The Arecanut Disease Detection project bridges the gap between traditional farming practices and modern technological innovations. The system uses a dataset comprising images of healthy and diseased arecanut plants (leaves, trunks, and nuts) for training a CNN model. It provides actionable recommendations to farmers, enhancing crop management efficiency, reducing losses, and supporting sustainable agricultural practices.

---

## Literature Survey
Recent studies exploring plant disease detection include:

- **Dhanuja K C (2020):** Used texture-based grading and the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm for arecanut disease detection with a dataset of 144 samples.
- **Manpreet Sandhu et al. (2020):** Employed machine learning algorithms for leaf image classification, utilizing drone-captured images.
- **Ashish Nage et al. (2019):** Developed an Android application for plant disease identification using CNN.
- **Swathy Ann Sam et al. (2020):** Compared CNN, KNN, SVM, and Decision Trees, achieving 86% accuracy with CNN.

This project builds on these studies by focusing specifically on arecanut disease detection, expanding the scope to include trunk and fruit analysis.

## Research Gaps in Existing Methods
Despite advancements, several research gaps persist in existing arecanut disease detection methods:

- **Data Limitations:** Small and imbalanced datasets, inadequate diversity, and poor data quality.
- **Methodological Shortcomings:** Issues such as overfitting, limited feature extraction, and ineffective transfer learning.
- **Performance Challenges:** Struggles with accuracy, speed, and robustness.

Future research should focus on collecting diverse and high-quality data, improving model training methods, and enabling real-time detection integrated with existing farming systems.
